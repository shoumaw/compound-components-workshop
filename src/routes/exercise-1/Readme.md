# Exercise: Implementing a Stateless Breadcrumbs Component in React

## Overview

In this exercise, you will implement a stateless `Breadcrumbs` component in React using three different patterns:

1. **Configuration Component Pattern**
2. **Render Props Pattern**
3. **Compound Component Pattern**

For each pattern, you are provided with:

- The `App.tsx` component that uses the `Breadcrumbs` component.
- Empty `Breadcrumbs.tsx` and `BreadcrumbItem.tsx` files that you need to implement from scratch.

Your task is to fill in the `Breadcrumbs.tsx` and `BreadcrumbItem.tsx` components according to each pattern and use the `Breadcrumbs/BreadcrumbItem` components as needed in the `App.tsx`
